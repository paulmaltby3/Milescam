# Milescam
Raspberry Pi python project to create a PIR sensor controlled camera to take pictures of the neighbours cat in our garden. 
Also includes an incomplete website that I made with my 8 year old daughter to display some of the images and describe the cat

photos referenced in the html include:
catpic1.jpg

The python script saves the latest photo as milespic.jpg
